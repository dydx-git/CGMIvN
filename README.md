# Description
Chrome extension for copying message id of an opened email in Gmail.

# Disclaimer
Inspired by [Gmail message ID finder](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmail-message-id-finder/comcoiiifldaaejpbgbincdkoohihbae?hl=en) but with the recent 
Gmail update, that extension no longer works. Hence, this new one!
